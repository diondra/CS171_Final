  </div>

  <p>In 1796, the world was changed forever when Edward Jenner successfully tested the first vaccine, a cure for smallpox.
      Now, more than 2 centuries, we are still being protected by vaccinations.
      Studies show that vaccinations will prevent more than <b>21 million</b> hospitalizations and <b>700,000</b> deaths among children born in the last 20 years.
      But vaccines can't save everyone at once. They only work the immunization process.
      Learn about what vaccines are protecting you against.</p>

      <h2>How Vaccines Prevent Against Disease</h2>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"><p> Vaccines aren't a miracle cure. The real hero is <b>you</b>!
              A vaccine consists on an inactive form of the disease that it trying to protect against.
              Your body's immune system is quite strong and can easily wipe out that form of the disease.
              Further, your body is really smart! Much like a child studying from a book, your body learns about the disease from fighting it.
              It remembers how it destroyed that disease so the next time it sees it (even if it's the dangerous active form of the disease), <b>it can protect you from any harm!</b>

      <h2>Vaccines In Action: Polio</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6"><p>With theory alone, you might be skeptical of the power of vaccination, but in practice, the proof is in the polio!
            In the 1950s, when the polio epidemic was at its worst in the United States, approximately 50,000 people a year were struck with polio, paralyzing the lucky ones and killing the rest.
            Nearly all of the affected were children, so the disease was also known as "infantile paralysis." Then, in 1955, Dr. Jonas Salk released the polio vaccine, which was then widely distributed.
            By 1962, there were no more than a thousand polio cases nationwide. And now, <b>there hasn't been a single polio case since 1979</b>. And while that seems long ago, it is still recent history; around the world, there are still 10 to 20 million living polio survivors according to the WHO.
            It's a long and hard fight, but thanks to vaccinations, polio is on its way to total eradication.</p>

            	Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family and it is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the respiratory tract , then spreads throughout the body.</br></br> Source: https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html

      <p>It might be easy to think that the viruses to lead to deadly diseases no longer exist, but that is not the case. In just 2015, a case of measles broke out in California in Disneyland and that one case led to the infection of over 100 people in 10 states and across 3 countries over the period of 3 months.
          The graph below shows the time and the amount of people infected during the duration of the outbreak.</p>

      <h2>Herd Immunity</h2>
      <p>Herd Immunity is the phenomenon where a community of individuals can be protected from an infectious disease when a large enough percentage of the population is immune (like by vaccination).
      This is especially important because not everyone in a community is eligible to receive all vaccinations (i.e. newborns, those with specific medical conditions).
      Herd immunity can also protect against widespread outbreaks, because the pathogen will be unable to spread if it is difficult to find infected individuals. Herd immunity helps us fight against disease outbreaks like the measles. Explore the phenomena below!

      <br><br>
      This visualization simulates the total percentage of the population that is susceptible to be infected during a measles outbreak given current MMR vaccination levels. The people in <span class="green">green</span> represent vaccinated individuals. Those in <span class="red">red</span> are unvaccinated individuals. This visualization has two parts. On the left is a simulation of herd immunity in action. Choose a state from the drop-down menu to use its immunization rate.
      On the right is a simulation of an extreme case of <i>lack of</i> herd immunity. Here we use the current immunization rates from Ukraine to simulate what would happen if the measles were to break out there.

      <br><br>
      <b>To begin either exploration, "infect" the population by clicking a person below. Individuals that turn <span class="black">black</span> represent those infected from your simulated outbreak. Choose "Repopulate" at any time to pick new parameters to explore.</b> Note: This visualization makes no comment on the <i>speed</i> of the infection as every outbreak is unique, but note the <i>spread</i> of the infection. </p>
